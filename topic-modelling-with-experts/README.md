# Topic modelling files
This folder contains documents that were manually filled in at various steps of topic modelling (with experts). For results from automatic clustering refer to `dataset.xlsx` in the main folder:
* `initial_clister_analysis` contains an initial assessment of the topics covered by each of the 60 automatic clusters.
* `MICRO TOPICS - STEP 1` is re-elaboration of the above file, by skimming all "main" topics and listing all the clusters that fall into it. Note that, because of cluster pollution, many automatic clusters will fall within multiple topics.
* `MICRO TOPICS - STEP 2` is a further re-elaboration, followed by proposed names for the actual clusters (those that are also present in the "cluster_micro_expert" column of `dataset.xlsx`)

For the merging logic please refer to the paper or the "INFO" tab in `dataset.xlsx`.

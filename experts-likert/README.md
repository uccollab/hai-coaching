# Annotation documents
This folder contains the results from the final Likert form that the annotators (experts in nutrition) filled in, where they were asked to evaluate the candidates they annotated based on various metrics including clarity and humanlikeness.
The results are available ad an Excel spreadsheet (in `likert-results.xlsx`).

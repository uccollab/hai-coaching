## Dataset file structure
The HAI-coaching dataset is in the  ``dataset.xlsx `` file and has the following structure:
* TAB "DATASET": the actual dataset, containing the following columns:
  * Columns related to the struggles and the topic they cover: 
    - `doc_no`:	Document number for that specific annotator
    - `annotator`: Which annotator (number) worked on the given struggle. If "ALL", then the struggle was used for IAA, hence annotated by everyone.	
    - `struggle`:	The struggle, after typo correction.
    - `cluster_auto`:	Coarse clustering, obtained automatically. Hyperparameters were set to capture main topics. Has been used as an aiding tool during topic modelling with experts.	
    - `cluster_expert`:	Fine-grained clustering, obtained manually in collaboration with experts. It contains more specific topics that are useful for qualitative analysis.	
    - `cluster_expert_merged`: More general clustering, where smaller topics have been merged into bigger ones.
    - `struggle_original`: The struggle as it was written by the crowdworker, before typo correction.	
    - `full_embeddings`: Embeddings for the struggle, from all-mpnet model. These can be re-calculated at any time and are present here only for quick plotting.
    - `reduced_embeddings`:	Embeddings after PCA, for 3D plotting purposes.
    			
  * Candidates from ChatGPT and their annotation. For IAA, majority voting was used. 
      - `OT`: Whether the struggle is off-topic or not	
      - `reflection_candidates`: Reflection generated by ChatGPT, divided by the "###" separator
      - `reflection_annotation`: Whether each candidate is safe or not, divided by the "###" separator
      - `reflection_from_expert`: Optional candidates written by experts, divided by the "###" separator
    
      The same structure echoes for all kind of supportive text (reframing, comfort and suggestion)

* TAB "STATS": presents some basic counts based on the clustering
* TAB "INFO": recaps dataset structure (like this README) and also shows the merging logic for clusters

  * Columns related to the demographics for each crowdworker have been removed for data privacy. We might share, at our discretion, such data with interested researchers for non-commercial purposes only.   


## Working with the dataset
The file ``dataset_parsing.ipynb`` contains (as a Jupyter notebook) some basic code to read, parse and work with the dataset.

## Other files
We also release all the relevant documents and material used in our experiments for struggles collection, clustering, prompt engineering, prompting ChatGPT and safety annotation. Each step has its own directory and README file.

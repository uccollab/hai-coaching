# Annotation documents
This folder contains the documents that were sent to the nutrition experts for annotating the safety of text generated by ChatGPT:
* `annotationd_guidelines.pdf` contains guidelines and FAQ that experts used when annotating
* `dummy_annotation_form_not_fillable.pdf` has a dummy version of the form that each annotator received (non-modifiable). Annotators received one of these documents for each struggle, containing all 40 candidates produced by ChatGPT
* `dummy_annotation_form_fillable.docx` is the same but can be modified (and filled in). Provided mainly for re-use.
